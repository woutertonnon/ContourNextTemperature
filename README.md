# Contour Next One Temperature Study
In this repository, you find the code that was used to perform the study on the temperature dependence of the Contour Next One Blood Glucose meter for the blog https://ridingtheglucosetrail.com.

Run the file 'ProcessData.py' to obtain the figures as published in the blog. You can change the variable 'number_of_averaged_samples' to obtain the prediction confidence intervals in case of multiple averaged samples.
